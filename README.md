- **Processes large-scale healthcare data** using distributed computing.
- **Performs clinical analytics** such as length-of-stay prediction and readmission analysis.
- **Implements MapReduce algorithms** for parallel processing of medical records.
- **Uses SQL-based analytics** through Apache Hive for structured healthcare queries.
- **Containerizes the pipeline** using Docker for easy deployment.

## 🏗️ System Architecture

### 📊 Pipeline Flow
1. **MIMIC-III Demo Dataset**: Raw healthcare data input.
2. **Docker Environment**: Containerized Hadoop ecosystem setup.
3. **Python Data Cleaning**: Preprocessing with Pandas.
4. **Parquet Conversion**: Optimized columnar storage format.
5. **Hadoop HDFS**: Distributed data storage.
6. **MapReduce Jobs**: Java-based parallel processing (e.g., average age calculation).
7. **Apache Hive**: SQL-based analytics and table creation.

## ✨ Key Features
### 🔧 Technical Implementation
- **Containerized Environment**: Docker setup with Hadoop, Hive, and Spark.
- **Distributed Storage**: HDFS for scalable data storage.
- **SQL Analytics**: Complex Hive queries for healthcare insights.
- **Custom MapReduce**: Java-based parallel processing algorithms.

📊 Analytics Examples
🔍 Hive SQL Analytics
Average Length of Stay by Diagnosis:

sql

نسخ
SELECT 
    diagnosis,
    AVG(los_days) AS avg_length_of_stay,
    COUNT(*) AS patient_count,
    STDDEV(los_days) AS std_deviation
FROM admissions 
WHERE los_days > 0
GROUP BY diagnosis
ORDER BY avg_length_of_stay DESC
LIMIT 20;
30-Day Readmission Analysis:

        subject_id,
        hadm_id,
        admittime,
        dischtime,
